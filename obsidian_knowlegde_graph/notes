this is for nodes with more than 200 nodes 
let k_spring = 0.001;
            let k_repel = 1.0;
            let k_link_nudge = 0.01;
            let c = 0.01;

            let max_movement = 100.0;
			
for 10 nodes or less this works great 
            let k_spring = 0.0001;
            let k_repel = 5.0;
            let k_link_nudge = 0.01;
            let c = 1.0;
works for 60 simple nodes to 


ok so today is nov 2 2024
what i am doing is trying to get the drag to be as good as the zoom
to do this i need to use egui functions as egui as good predifine fucnitons
I have realized the raw_scroll_delta is the same as draggin so i want to use this to make it
so i can drag as good and the lock book canvas which would make it look much nicer and many times more
proffesional, so i will have to look more into raw_srcoll_delta that is the changes i have made to the code
today.

so raw scroll_delta is the drag information and i can use this raw_sroll_delata to change the postion of the noes
and where they are change. So i have to do that.

Ok now i am able to make it so i can drag with 2 fingers and have made the drag much smoother and better


figured out why it is not working if it is on the negvative x axis or postive x axis it goes to the other cirecurfurmce 
and not the one that i want it to go for

ok attempted a change and now need to try and fix to see if it is working

Data 11/14/2024
Today i did a good amount of stuff to make it look nicer
fixed the arrow so it is always on the outside of the cirle at the intersection point
fixed it so arrow is no longer transparent 
make it so arrow is always ontop of everything else
make it so the name is ontop of everyhting 
changed the outline to a lightblue to make it so it is better to read and easyier
made it so arrows are just arrows instead of putting it ontop of a link so it looks nicer
