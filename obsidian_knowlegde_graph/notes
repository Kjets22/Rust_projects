this is for nodes with more than 200 nodes 
let k_spring = 0.001;
            let k_repel = 1.0;
            let k_link_nudge = 0.01;
            let c = 0.01;

            let max_movement = 100.0;
			
for 10 nodes or less this works great 
            let k_spring = 0.0001;
            let k_repel = 5.0;
            let k_link_nudge = 0.01;
            let c = 1.0;
works for 60 simple nodes to 


ok so today is nov 2 2024
what i am doing is trying to get the drag to be as good as the zoom
to do this i need to use egui functions as egui as good predifine fucnitons
I have realized the raw_scroll_delta is the same as draggin so i want to use this to make it
so i can drag as good and the lock book canvas which would make it look much nicer and many times more
proffesional, so i will have to look more into raw_srcoll_delta that is the changes i have made to the code
today.

so raw scroll_delta is the drag information and i can use this raw_sroll_delata to change the postion of the noes
and where they are change. So i have to do that.

Ok now i am able to make it so i can drag with 2 fingers and have made the drag much smoother and better
